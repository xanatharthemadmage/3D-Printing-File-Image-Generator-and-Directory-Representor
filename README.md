3D-Printing File Image Generator and Directory Representor is a tool designed to help 3d-print file collectors visualize their collections.

The program uses Blender to create a .png for every .stl or .obj file in a directory. 
The generated .png is then placed in the same folder as the file. 
Finall, all the images generated over within in the run are combined into one image quilt which is placed in the main directory

3D-Printing File Image Generator and Directory Representor is designed to work in blender and requires the python Pillow libarary. 

Requires Blender 2.8.X 
Requires Python Pillow

##########Setup############
